Normally, I only write Python and run everything on my local environment, or I just send the code to the development team to continue working on it. Most of the time, these projects aren't published because I work in a lab and the data can't be disclosed publicly.

It's different from just using AI when you don't know anything; you won't be able to fix anything because you don't understand it!
